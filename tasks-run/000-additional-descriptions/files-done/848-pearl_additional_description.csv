O. is a hybrid grain mixture with unique crystalline properties that enable individual grain particles to remain extremely sharp and durable. The MAX A.

The result is significantly increased efficiency and performance when compared to traditional aluminum oxide wheels. </p> <p>Less vibration<br>The Redline» MAX A. O. wheel's combination of a proprietary bonding system and the MAX A. O. grain create a wheel that offers near perfect balance, with significantly less vibration or ""Wheel chatter.

It is also very helpful in making the wheel user friendly, decreasing both operator fatigue and wear on the angle grinder. </p> <p>Cooler grinding<br>Because the Redline» MAX A.
