Provides positive holding and controlled, “chatter-free” lowering of a load. Operation: Load is raised at flow rate of pump, and held when pump is shut off. When the pump is shifted to “retract, ” the counter balance valve will continue to hold the load until system pressure exceeds pressure caused by load. The load can then be lowered smoothly to the flow rate of the pump. The counter balance valve is designed to operate with pumps having a high pressure flow rate of up to 120 cu. in. min. and cylinder ratios of 3 to 1. caution: The 9720 patented counter balance valve has a pilot pressure as high as 3, 000 psi. Because this pressure is applied to the rod end of the cylinder while it is already under load, the system should not be sized for loads greater than 80% of cylinder rated capacity. caution: To prevent sudden, uncontrolled descent of a load as it is being lowered, use a Load Lowering Valve  (No. 9596) or Counter Balance Valve  (No. 9720) in conjunction with the directional valve used in your application.</p><h5>Specifications</h5><table class=""description-table""><tbody><tr><th>Order No. </th><td>9721</td></tr><tr><th>Cylinder Application *</th><td>S.

Note: 9504 can be remote mounted with a 9510 Sub-plates. Note: a Pressure Switch and/or Gauge  (Analog or Digital) may be attached to this valve. caution: To prevent sudden, uncontrolled descent of a load as it is being lowered, use a Load Lowering Valve  (No. 9596) or Counter Balance Valve  (No. 9720) in conjunction with the directional valve used in your application. important: Conversion kit 251528 must be used when mounting any of the valves on PA17 or PE17 pumps. important: When ordering any valve for a PE30 or PG30 series pump, ½” longer mounting screws are required. For valves 9504, 9584, 9610 and 9610A, order four 12001 cap screws. For valve 9582, order two 12001 and two 10856 cap screws. Note: Valves 9501, 9502, 9504 and 9507 can have a port blocked or have a closed center position. When a port is blocked and the valve is shifted to the blocked port, the pump will generate excessive heat. An electric or rotary air pump can either be turned off manually or with a pressure switch. Reciprocating air pumps may be adjusted to stall out and stop. Note: Gauge ports monitor pump pressure only, not pressure to the hydraulic cylinder (s).</p><h5>Specifications</h5><table class=""description-table""><tbody><tr><th>Order No. </th><td>9504</td></tr><tr><th>Cylinder Application *</th><td>S.

When the pump is shifted to “retract, ” the counter balance valve will continue to hold the load until system pressure exceeds pressure caused by load. The load can then be lowered smoothly to the flow rate of the pump. The counter balance valve is designed to operate with pumps having a high pressure flow rate of up to 120 cu. in. min. and cylinder ratios of 3 to 1. caution: The 9720 patented counter balance valve has a pilot pressure as high as 3, 000 psi. Because this pressure is applied to the rod end of the cylinder while it is already under load, the system should not be sized for loads greater than 80% of cylinder rated capacity. caution: To prevent sudden, uncontrolled descent of a load as it is being lowered, use a Load Lowering Valve  (No. 9596) or Counter Balance Valve  (No. 9720) in conjunction with the directional valve used in your application.</p><h5>Specifications</h5><table class=""description-table""><tbody><tr><th>Order No. </th><td>9720</td></tr><tr><th>Cylinder Application *</th><td>S.

With port ""B"" plugged, solenoid is energized to position ""A, "" oil port ""A"" becomes pressurized. When solenoid is energized to position ""B, "" oil port ""A"" becomes the return port. Operation with multiple single-acting cylinders: a pressure line from one bank can be connected to oil port ""A"" and the other to oil port ""B"" on the valve. Sequence: When energized to position ""A, "" oil port ""A"" becomes pressurized and clamps the fixture connected to oil port ""A""; oil port ""B"" becomes a ""return"" port for cylinder connected to oil port ""B, "" and retracts it. The opposite happens when solenoid ""B"" is energized. Operation with double-acting cylinder: Port ""A"" is connected to ""advance"" port of cylinder, oil port ""B"" connects to cylinder ""return"" port. solenoid is energized to position ""A, "" oil port ""A"" becomes pressurized to extend cylinder piston. The opposite happens when solenoid ""B"" is energized. Valve does not hold in ""retract"" position. Note: When using more than one valve on a pump, the tank port may require a check valve to permit inadvertent, momentary extension of a retracted cylinder. Note: If pump is equipped with an internal outlet check, a ""hold"" position can be maintained with the pump shut off. Note: Valves are shipped without control switch.

Operation with single-acting cylinder: Either oil port “A” or “B” must be plugged on valve. With port “B” plugged, solenoid is energized to position “A, ” oil port “A” becomes pressurized. When solenoid is energized to position “B, ” oil port “A” becomes the return port. Operation with multiple single-acting cylinders: a pressure line from one bank can be connected to oil port “A” and the other to oil port “B” on the valve. Sequence: When energized to position “A, ” oil port “A” becomes pressurized and clamps the fixture connected to oil port “A”; oil port “B” becomes a “return” port for cylinder connected to oil port “B, ” and retracts it. The opposite happens when solenoid “B” is energized. Operation with double-acting cylinder: Port “A” is connected to “advance” port of cylinder, oil port “B” connects to cylinder “return” port. solenoid is energized to position “A, ” oil port “A” becomes pressurized to extend cylinder piston. The opposite happens when solenoid “B” is energized. Valve does not hold in “retract” position. Note: When using more than one valve on a pump, the tank port may require a check valve  (9580) to permit inadvertent, momentary extension of a retracted cylinder.

Note: Valves are shipped without control switch. caution: To prevent sudden, uncontrolled descent of a load as it is being lowered, use a Load Lowering Valve  (No. 9596) or Counter Balance Valve  (No. 9720) in conjunction with the directional valve used in your application. important: Conversion kit 251528 must be used when mounting the 9609 valve on PA17 or PE17 pumps. important: When ordering any valve for a PE30 or PG30 series pump, ½” longer mounting screws are required. For valves 9513 and 9519, order four 11956 cap screws. For valves 9523, 9553 and 9589, order four 10855 cap screws.
