For optimum seal life, these right-angle gearmotors have a lubrication breather positioned for horizontal mounting. For other mountings, the breather plug must be reoriented by using a 90 1/8 NPT taper pipe elbow. See page 97 or 106 for diagram. Overhung load capacities shown are at center of the output shaft. The motor’s stall torque exceeds recommended full load torques for the gearboxes. A current limiting device should be used to prevent damage to the gear sets. </p><p> Leeson gearbox output shafts are 303 stainless steel. Frame, endshields, armature and interior components protected by enamel and polyester compounds for resistance to moisture, acids, alkalies and oil. Cast conduit box with threaded conduit holes and Nitrile gaskets keep water out. The conduit box cover is made from 304 stainless steel. For any condensation that may accumulate inside the motor, a one-way stainless steel vapor vent is provided. All hardware is stainless steel. Motor painted with epoxy for superior corrosion resistance and protection. Machined fits between the endbells and motor frame are sealed with gaskets. Thru-bolt heads and nuts sealed with fiber washers. O-rings under each threaded brush cover. This worm-type right-angle gearing features hardened, steel worm with bronze worm wheel for long life and quiet operation. Precision machined aluminum housings are used. Gearbox has all ball bearings. The housing is sealed and lubrication is permanent with an oil bath. </p>"

For optimum seal life, these right-angle gearmotors have a lubrication breather positioned for horizontal mounting. For other mountings, the breather plug must be reoriented by using a 90 1/8 NPT taper pipe elbow. See page 97 or 106 for diagram. Overhung load capacities shown are at center of the output shaft. The motor’s stall torque exceeds recommended full load torques for the gearboxes. A current limiting device should be used to prevent damage to the gear sets. </p><p> Gearbox output shafts are 303 stainless steel. Frame, endshields, armature and interior components protected by enamel and polyester compounds for resistance to moisture, acids, alkalies and oil. Cast conduit box with threaded conduit holes and Nitrile gaskets keep water out. The conduit box cover is made from 304 stainless steel. For any condensation that may accumulate inside the motor, a one-way stainless steel vapor vent is provided. All hardware is stainless steel. Motor painted with epoxy for superior corrosion resistance and protection. Machined fits between the endbells and motor frame are sealed with gaskets. Thru-bolt heads and nuts sealed with fiber washers. O-rings under each threaded brush cover. This worm-type right-angle gearing features hardened, steel worm with bronze worm wheel for long life and quiet operation. Precision machined aluminum housings are used. Gearbox has all ball bearings. The housing is sealed and lubrication is permanent with an oil bath. </p>"
227331,"<h5>Applications</h5><p> This gearmotor is designed for mounting at any angle, but motor below the reducer should be avoided to prevent leakage of lubricant into the motor should the motor shaft seal fail. Motor’s stall torque could exceed recommended full load torques. A current limiting device such as an SCR control should be used to prevent damage. This issue is even more critical for low voltage motors, typically no controller is used since motor is connected directly to a battery, so some type of current limit or fusing should be considered. Overhung load capacities shown are at center of output shaft. </p><h5>Features</h5><ul><li>Made in the USA</li> <li>Steel frame</li> <li>Precision machined in-line steel gears</li> <li>First stage steel helical gear followed by spur-type gears</li> <li>Lubrication is permanent semi-fluid grease, reducing possibility of leakage</li> <li>Output shafts have needle bearings for high load capacities</li> <li>Shafts are hardened steel</li> <li>Conduit box not included, optional conduit box available</li>  <li>Footnotes: S, US</li></ul>"

Motor’s stall torque could exceed recommended full load torques. A current limiting device such as an SCR control should be used to prevent damage. This issue is even more critical for low voltage motors, typically no controller is used since motor is connected directly to a battery, so some type of current limit or fusing should be considered.

227366,"<h5>Applications</h5><p> This gearmotor is designed for mounting at any angle, but motor below the reducer should be avoided to prevent leakage of lubricant into the motor should the motor shaft seal fail. Motor’s stall torque could exceed recommended full load torques. A current limiting device such as an SCR control should be used to prevent damage. This issue is even more critical for low voltage motors, typically no controller is used since motor is connected directly to a battery, so some type of current limit or fusing should be considered. Overhung load capacities shown are at center of output shaft. </p><h5>Features</h5><ul><li>Made in the USA</li> <li>Steel frame</li> <li>Precision machined in-line steel gears</li> <li>First stage steel helical gear followed by spur-type gears</li> <li>Lubrication is permanent semi-fluid grease, reducing possibility of leakage</li> <li>Output shafts have needle bearings for high load capacities</li> <li>Shafts are hardened steel</li> <li>Conduit box not included, optional conduit box available</li>  <li>Footnotes: S, US</li></ul>"

Shaft with spring-loaded contact shaft seal protect the double sealed ball bearings and motor interior. Frame, endshields, armature and interior components protected by enamel and polyester compounds for resistance to moisture, acids, alkalies and oil. </p> <p>Cast conduit box with threaded conduit holes and Nitrile gaskets keep water out. The conduit box cover is made from 304 stainless steel. </p> <p>For any condensation that may accumulate inside the motor a one-way stainless steel vapor vent is provided. All hardware is stainless steel. Motor painted with white epoxy for superior corrosion resistance and protection. Gaskets seal conduit box to motor frame and conduit box cover. Thru-bolt heads and nuts sealed with fiber washers. O-rings under each threaded brush cover. </p> <h5>Application Notes</h5><p>Leeson WASHGUARD motors are designed for extended life in applications requiring regular washdown or otherwise wet environments. Washguard motors retard the entrance of water.
