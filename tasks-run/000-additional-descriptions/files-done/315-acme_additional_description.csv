Acme Electric introduces a line of Harmonic Mitigating Transformers that combine the technologies shown in our non-linear load (K-Factor) transformers. Where conventional K-Factor transformers ""deal"" with harmonics, containing them within the transformer and preventing them from going further upstream; Harmonic Mitigating Transformers eliminate harmonics by pitting them against themselves.

All our DITs use a three leg wound core. This superior design has very low losses and quiet operation. Both of these features combine to significantly reduce losses and operation costs compared to other types of constructions. All Acme DITs up to and including the 220kVA have copper terminations. The transition from aluminum strip coil conductors to copper terminations is accomplished by a bonding process known as ""Koldwelding"" This process has been used by Acme for over 25 years to provide a trouble-free, permanent bonding of the two metals. </p><ul><li>7. 5–20. 0 kVA are encapsulated, UL 3R </li> <li> 3-Phase 60 Hertz </li> <li> 180°C and 220°C insulation systems </li> <li> Acme’s reinforced core assemblies enhance quiet operation </li> <li> Nominally 6% impedance </li> <li> Designed for use with AC, adjustable frequency or DC drives </li> <li> Full capacity taps are featured on all units.

The inherent excellent line isolation of these transformers is further enhanced with the extra protection of Acme’s Electrostatic Shield — free in all DIT’s. </td></tr><tr><th>Lower losses</th><td>The harmonic currents generated by AC &amp; DC drives increase eddy current losses (heat) in transformer windings. The thicker the winding conductor, the greater the losses. Acme uses one turn per layer of thin strip conductor which provides lower eddy current losses than comparable wire wound units. Lower losses = cooler operation and longer transformer life. </td></tr><tr><th>Reduced short circuit forces</th><td>Strip windings minimize axial short circuit forces that can cause mechanical displacement of the windings under fault conditions.

884901,"<p>230 Delta Primary Volts - 230Y/133 Secondary Volts - All Acme Drive Isolation Transformers (DITs) above 7. 5kVA are wound with strip windings to ensure the lowest possible eddy current losses. All our DITs use a three leg wound core. This superior design has very low losses and quiet operation. Both of these features combine to significantly reduce losses and operation costs compared to other types of constructions. All Acme DITs up to and including the 220kVA have copper terminations. The transition from aluminum strip coil conductors to copper terminations is accomplished by a bonding process known as ""Koldwelding"" This process has been used by Acme for over 25 years to provide a trouble-free, permanent bonding of the two metals. </p><ul><li>UL Type 3R Enclosures with Weather Shield on Ventilated Units (above 20 kVA).

The inherent excellent line isolation of these transformers is further enhanced with the extra protection of Acme’s Electrostatic Shield — free in all DIT’s. </li><li>Lower losses: The harmonic currents generated by AC &amp; DC drives increase eddy current losses (heat) in transformer windings. The thicker the winding conductor, the greater the losses. Acme uses one turn per layer of thin strip conductor which provides lower eddy current losses than comparable wire wound units.

When supplying power to these loads, a special transformer design is necessary. Typical non-linear loads include desktop computers, AC variable speed drives, HID lighting, electronic ballasts, inverters and welders. Of these non-linear loads, the major source of harmonic currents is the switch mode power supply found in desktop computers, data processors and other office equipment. Acme Non-Linear Load Isolation Transformers use special winding techniques to minimize eddy current losses generated by harmonic currents. A double-sized neutral conductor handles the excessive neutral current found in non-linear load applications.

884839,"<p>480 Delta Primary Volts - 208Y/120 Secondary Volts - Many of today's electronic devices are non-linear loads generating high levels of harmonic currents that are then fed back onto your distribution system. This waveform distortion results in overheating of motors and transformers, increased neutral currents and malfuntion/damage to other equipment on the line. Acme Electric introduces a line of Harmonic Mitigating Transformers that combine the technologies shown in our non-linear load (K-Factor) transformers. Where conventional K-Factor transformers ""deal"" with harmonics, containing them within the transformer and preventing them from going further upstream; Harmonic Mitigating Transformers eliminate harmonics by pitting them against themselves.

Of these non-linear loads, the major source of harmonic currents is the switch mode power supply found in desktop computers, data processors and other office equipment.

884914,"<p>460 Delta Primary Volts - 230Y/133 Secondary Volts - All Acme Drive Isolation Transformers (DITs) above 7. 5kVA are wound with strip windings to ensure the lowest possible eddy current losses. All our DITs use a three leg wound core. This superior design has very low losses and quiet operation. Both of these features combine to significantly reduce losses and operation costs compared to other types of constructions. All Acme DITs up to and including the 220kVA have copper terminations. The transition from aluminum strip coil conductors to copper terminations is accomplished by a bonding process known as ""Koldwelding"" This process has been used by Acme for over 25 years to provide a trouble-free, permanent bonding of the two metals. </p><ul><li>7. 5–20. 0 kVA are encapsulated, UL 3R </li> <li> 3-Phase 60 Hertz </li> <li> 180°C and 220°C insulation systems </li> <li> Acme’s reinforced core assemblies enhance quiet operation </li> <li> Nominally 6% impedance </li> <li> Designed for use with AC, adjustable frequency or DC drives </li> <li> Full capacity taps are featured on all units.

The inherent excellent line isolation of these transformers is further enhanced with the extra protection of Acme’s Electrostatic Shield — free in all DIT’s. </td></tr><tr><th>Lower losses</th><td>The harmonic currents generated by AC &amp; DC drives increase eddy current losses (heat) in transformer windings. The thicker the winding conductor, the greater the losses. Acme uses one turn per layer of thin strip conductor which provides lower eddy current losses than comparable wire wound units. Lower losses = cooler operation and longer transformer life. </td></tr><tr><th>Reduced short circuit forces</th><td>Strip windings minimize axial short circuit forces that can cause mechanical displacement of the windings under fault conditions.

Acme Electric introduces a line of Harmonic Mitigating Transformers that combine the technologies shown in our non-linear load (K-Factor) transformers. Where conventional K-Factor transformers ""deal"" with harmonics, containing them within the transformer and preventing them from going further upstream; Harmonic Mitigating Transformers eliminate harmonics by pitting them against themselves.
