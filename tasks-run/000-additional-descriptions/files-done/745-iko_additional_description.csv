There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication.

863968,"<p>Spherical Bushings are self-aligning spherical plain bushings that have inner and outer rings with spherical sliding surfaces, and can take a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication.

Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication.

860607,"<p>Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings are light weight bearings with large load ratings. They employ a shell type outer ring made from a thin special steel plate which is accurately drawn, carburized and quenched, thus providing the lowest sectional height among the needle roller bearings. There are two types of bearings available in this series; the caged type and the full complement type. The appropriate type can be selected according to the operating conditions. The caged type has a structure in which the needle rollers are accurately guided by the cage and thrust rings. It is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type needle roller bearing, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation. Since these bearings are press-fitted into the housing, no fixtures for axial positioning are needed. They are ideal for use in mass-produced articles that require economy, and have a wide variety of applications.</p>"

863949,"<p>Spherical Bushings are self-aligning spherical plain bushings that have inner and outer rings with spherical sliding surfaces, and can take a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication. They are especially suitable in cases where fixed directional loads are applied and are used mainly in food processing machines and construction machinery and in other applications in which the use of oil is undesirable or lubrication is not possible.</p>"

863987,"<p>Spherical Bushings are self-aligning spherical plain bushings that have inner and outer rings with spherical sliding surfaces, and can take a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication. They are especially suitable in cases where fixed directional loads are applied and are used mainly in food processing machines and construction machinery and in other applications in which the use of oil is undesirable or lubrication is not possible.</p>"

The caged type has a structure in which the needle rollers are accurately guided by the cage and thrust rings. It is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type needle roller bearing, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation.

There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication. They are especially suitable in cases where fixed directional loads are applied and are used mainly in food processing machines and construction machinery and in other applications in which the use of oil is undesirable or lubrication is not possible.</p>"

863862,"<p>Spherical Bushings are self-aligning spherical plain bushings that have inner and outer rings with spherical sliding surfaces, and can take a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication. They are especially suitable in cases where fixed directional loads are applied and are used mainly in food processing machines and construction machinery and in other applications in which the use of oil is undesirable or lubrication is not possible.</p>"

863921,"<p>Spherical Bushings are self-aligning spherical plain bushings that have inner and outer rings with spherical sliding surfaces, and can take a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. There are many types of Spherical Bushings, but they are basically divided into steel-on-steel types and maintenance-free types according to the kind of sliding surfaces. Steel-on-steel Spherical Bushings have inner and outer rings of high carbon chromium bearing steel, of which sliding surfaces are phosphate-treated and then dry-coated with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). They can, therefore, operate with low torque, and have excellent wear resistance and large load capacity. They are especially suitable for applications where there are alternate loads and shock loads. They have wide applications mainly in industrial and construction machinery. Maintenance-free Spherical Bushings consist of an outer ring which has a special PTFE liner reinforce with copper alloy meshes on the sliding surface, and a spherical inner ring of which sliding surface has a hard chromium plating. Creep deformation due to compressive load is small, and wear resistance is superior. Thus, they are maintenance-free and can be used for extended periods of time without re-lubrication. They are especially suitable in cases where fixed directional loads are applied and are used mainly in food processing machines and construction machinery and in other applications in which the use of oil is undesirable or lubrication is not possible.</p>"

860910,"<p>Shell Type Needle Roller Bearings are light weight bearings with large load ratings. They employ a shell type outer ring made from a thin special steel plate which is accurately drawn, carburized and quenched, thus providing the lowest sectional height among the needle roller bearings. There are two types of bearings available in this series; the caged type and the full complement type. The appropriate type can be selected according to the operating conditions. The caged type has a structure in which the needle rollers are accurately guided by the cage and thrust rings. It is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type needle roller bearing, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation. Since these bearings are press-fitted into the housing, no fixtures for axial positioning are needed. They are ideal for use in mass-produced articles that require economy, and have a wide variety of applications.</p>"

861340,"<p>Roller Followers are bearings designed for outer ring rotation, in which needle rollers are incorporated in a thick walled outer ring. Both crowned and cylindrical outer rings are available. The outer rings run directly on mating track surfaces, and the crowned outer ring is effective in relieving the edge load caused by mounting errors. The cylindrical outer ring, on the other hand, has a large contact area with the mating track surface and is suitable for applications involving large loads or low track surface hardness. In Roller Followers, there are two types of bearings available, the caged type and the full complement type. The caged type is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation or oscillating motions. Roller Followers include separable and non-separable types. Also, in addition to the open type, shield type and sealed type are available. The clearances between the side plates and outer ring of the shield type are narrow, and form labyrinths. In the sealed, special synthetic rubber seals are assembled in these clearances, and they are effective in preventing penetration of dust and dirt. These bearings are available in a variety of types to suit almost any kind of application. They are widely used for cam mechanisms and for linear motions of conveying equipment.</p>"

In the die-cast type, a spherical inner ring makes direct contact with the bore surface of the body of special zinc die-cast alloy. In the maintenance-free type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special PTFE liner of maintenance-free type. Thus, a smooth rotational and oscillatory motion can be achieved with superior anti-wear and loading properties in each type. PILLOBALL Rod Ends have either a female thread in the body or a male thread on the body, and they can be easily assembled onto machines. Pilloballs are used in control and link mechanisms in machine tools, textile machines, packaging machines, etc. The maintenance-free type is especially suitable for loading in one direction and is the best choice for machines in which oil must be avoided such as food processing machine.

861658,"<p>Pilloballs are compact self-aligning spherical bushings that can support a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. These bushings are classified by sliding surface types, namely, insert type, die-cast type and maintenance-free type. In the insert type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special copper alloy bushing with superior run-in properties. In the die-cast type, a spherical inner ring makes direct contact with the bore surface of the body of special zinc die-cast alloy. In the maintenance-free type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special PTFE liner of maintenance-free type. Thus, a smooth rotational and oscillatory motion can be achieved with superior anti-wear and loading properties in each type. PILLOBALL Rod Ends have either a female thread in the body or a male thread on the body, and they can be easily assembled onto machines. Pilloballs are used in control and link mechanisms in machine tools, textile machines, packaging machines, etc. The maintenance-free type is especially suitable for loading in one direction and is the best choice for machines in which oil must be avoided such as food processing machine. Or machines which cannot be re-lubricated.</p>"

1912164,"<p>Pilloballs are compact self-aligning spherical bushings that can support a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. These bushings are classified by sliding surface types, namely, insert type, die-cast type and maintenance-free type. In the insert type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special copper alloy bushing with superior run-in properties. In the die-cast type, a spherical inner ring makes direct contact with the bore surface of the body of special zinc die-cast alloy. In the maintenance-free type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special PTFE liner of maintenance-free type. Thus, a smooth rotational and oscillatory motion can be achieved with superior anti-wear and loading properties in each type. PILLOBALL Rod Ends have either a female thread in the body or a male thread on the body, and they can be easily assembled onto machines. Pilloballs are used in control and link mechanisms in machine tools, textile machines, packaging machines, etc. The maintenance-free type is especially suitable for loading in one direction and is the best choice for machines in which oil must be avoided such as food processing machine. Or machines which cannot be re-lubricated.</p>"

862720,"<p>Roller Followers are bearings designed for outer ring rotation, in which needle rollers are incorporated in a thick walled outer ring. Both crowned and cylindrical outer rings are available. The outer rings run directly on mating track surfaces, and the crowned outer ring is effective in relieving the edge load caused by mounting errors. The cylindrical outer ring, on the other hand, has a large contact area with the mating track surface and is suitable for applications involving large loads or low track surface hardness. In Roller Followers, there are two types of bearings available, the caged type and the full complement type. The caged type is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation or oscillating motions. Roller Followers include separable and non-separable types. Also, in addition to the open type, shield type and sealed type are available. The clearances between the side plates and outer ring of the shield type are narrow, and form labyrinths. In the sealed, special synthetic rubber seals are assembled in these clearances, and they are effective in preventing penetration of dust and dirt. These bearings are available in a variety of types to suit almost any kind of application. They are widely used for cam mechanisms and for linear motions of conveying equipment.</p>"

The outer rings run directly on mating track surfaces, and the crowned outer ring is effective in relieving the edge load caused by mounting errors. The cylindrical outer ring, on the other hand, has a large contact area with the mating track surface and is suitable for applications involving large loads or low track surface hardness. In Roller Followers, there are two types of bearings available, the caged type and the full complement type. The caged type is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation or oscillating motions. Roller Followers include separable and non-separable types. Also, in addition to the open type, shield type and sealed type are available. The clearances between the side plates and outer ring of the shield type are narrow, and form labyrinths. In the sealed, special synthetic rubber seals are assembled in these clearances, and they are effective in preventing penetration of dust and dirt. These bearings are available in a variety of types to suit almost any kind of application. They are widely used for cam mechanisms and for linear motions of conveying equipment.</p>"

862882,"<p>Roller Followers are bearings designed for outer ring rotation, in which needle rollers are incorporated in a thick walled outer ring. Both crowned and cylindrical outer rings are available. The outer rings run directly on mating track surfaces, and the crowned outer ring is effective in relieving the edge load caused by mounting errors. The cylindrical outer ring, on the other hand, has a large contact area with the mating track surface and is suitable for applications involving large loads or low track surface hardness. In Roller Followers, there are two types of bearings available, the caged type and the full complement type. The caged type is useful for applications at high-speed rotation. The full complement type, on the other hand, is suitable for heavy-load applications at low-speed rotation or oscillating motions. Roller Followers include separable and non-separable types. Also, in addition to the open type, shield type and sealed type are available. The clearances between the side plates and outer ring of the shield type are narrow, and form labyrinths.

863210,"<p>Pilloballs are compact self-aligning spherical bushings that can support a large radial load and a bi-directional axial load at the same time. These bushings are classified by sliding surface types, namely, insert type, die-cast type and maintenance-free type. In the insert type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special copper alloy bushing with superior run-in properties. In the die-cast type, a spherical inner ring makes direct contact with the bore surface of the body of special zinc die-cast alloy. In the maintenance-free type, a spherical inner ring makes contact with the special PTFE liner of maintenance-free type. Thus, a smooth rotational and oscillatory motion can be achieved with superior anti-wear and loading properties in each type. PILLOBALL Rod Ends have either a female thread in the body or a male thread on the body, and they can be easily assembled onto machines. Pilloballs are used in control and link mechanisms in machine tools, textile machines, packaging machines, etc. The maintenance-free type is especially suitable for loading in one direction and is the best choice for machines in which oil must be avoided such as food processing machine.

1911039,"<p>Crossed Roller Bearing is a bearing with compact structure in which the rollers are arranged so that they cross between the inner ring and the outer ring. Since the rolling surface is line contact, elastic displacement based on bearing load is extremely minimal, and in addition, it is able to receive complicated loads consisting of radial load, axial load, and moment at the same time. This bearing is broadly used in revolving parts that require compactness, high rigidity, and revolution accuracy such as industrial robots, machine tools, and medical equipment.

1911970,"<p>Linear Bushing LM is a high precision linear motion rolling guide which travels along a shaft to achieve endless linear motion. In the external cylinder, a retainer, steel balls, etc. are compactly incorporated. Wide variations in size are available for selections suitable for each application. Steel balls are accurately guided by a retainer, so low frictional resistance and stable linear motion can be achieved. It is easy to use Linear Bushings instead of conventional plain bushings, because both types are used with a round shaft, and no major redesign is necessary. For each dimensional series, standard, adjustable clearance and open types are available with and without seals, so the best linear bushing for the application may be selected. Linear Bushings made of stainless steel are also available. This type is suitable for applications where corrosion resistance is important.</p>"

1911961,"<p>Linear Bushing LM is a high precision linear motion rolling guide which travels along a shaft to achieve endless linear motion. In the external cylinder, a retainer, steel balls, etc. are compactly incorporated. Wide variations in size are available for selections suitable for each application. Steel balls are accurately guided by a retainer, so low frictional resistance and stable linear motion can be achieved. It is easy to use Linear Bushings instead of conventional plain bushings, because both types are used with a round shaft, and no major redesign is necessary. For each dimensional series, standard, adjustable clearance and open types are available with and without seals, so the best linear bushing for the application may be selected. Linear Bushings made of stainless steel are also available. This type is suitable for applications where corrosion resistance is important.</p>"
