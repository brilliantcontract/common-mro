"2798801","<p>Back-Up Ring, Solid, 25 in Inside Dia, Dash Number: AS568-474, -65 to 500 deg F, Virgin PTFE, Domestic</p></br></br>Back-up rings are used to prevent O-rings from extruding when the tight tolerances listed in the previous section cannot be maintained. Back-up rings do not provide any sealing function. They are simply intended to reduce the extrusion gap on the low-pressure side so that the O-ring can fulfill its sealing function without being damaged. Back-up rings are made of materials with better extrusion resistance than most elastomers. Several common materials are high durometer NBR (or other elastomers), nylon and filled PTFE. Since the materials used for back-up rings are basically non-compressible and non-deformable, they can typically be treated as though they are part of whatever the O-ring groove is machined into. That is, the width of the groove has to be increased just enough to accommodate the thickness of the back-up ring. For back-up rings with a curved surface facing the O-ring, the effective thickness of the back-up ring can be determined by dividing the cross sectional area of the back-up ring by the height of the back-up ring. This ensures that the O-ring has the same area to occupy."

For applications where the operating pressure is above 7 psi, a pressure seal will need to be used. If a standard shaft seal were to be used in a pressure application, the seal would be deformed due to the pressure being applied to the flex section of the seal. This deformation would lead to an increase in the contact between the seal and the shaft causing an increase in temperature and shaft wear. For this reason, pressure seals are standard shaft seals with a specially modified flex section design. The design of the flex section is dependant upon the amount of pressure that is present in the application. Dichtomatik's N style pressure seals are designed to function in applications where the operating pressure is above 30 psi. N style pressure seals are designed so that the flex section of the primary sealing lip gets progressively shorter as the applications operating pressure increases."

"2800920","<p>Axial Face Oil Seal, AFX, 80 Durometer, -40 to 225 deg F, Nitrile Lip, Zinc-Coated, Import</p></br></br>An axial face seal is a v-ring with an outer metal case added to it. Like a v-ring, an axial face seal mounts directly on a shaft and seals axially against either the housing or the metal case of a shaft seal. By incorporating a metal case into an axial face seal, they are able to seal out heavier contaminants than a v-ring would be able to. Unlike a v-ring, an axial face seal is not completely elastic, as a result of the addition of the outer metal case. This means that each axial face seal is designed for a specific shaft diameter rather than a range of shaft diameters like a v-ring. As was the case with v-rings, an axial face seal can either be used in conjunction with a shaft seal to provide additional contamination exclusion or they can be used by themselves in an application. The AFX style axial face seal is similar to the AFS except that the O.D. edge of the metal case extends beyond the rubber sealing lip. Because the metal case extends beyond the sealing lip, a groove needs to be machined into the housing to accept the metal case. In applications where heavy contamination is a concern, an AFX style seal would be better than an AFS because with the metal case extending into the housing there is a labyrinth created. By incorporating a labyrinth into the application the AFX will slow down the migration of the contaminants better than an AFS which will lead to longer seal life."

Like a v-ring, an axial face seal mounts directly on a shaft and seals axially against either the housing or the metal case of a shaft seal. By incorporating a metal case into an axial face seal, they are able to seal out heavier contaminants than a v-ring would be able to. Unlike a v-ring, an axial face seal is not completely elastic, as a result of the addition of the outer metal case. This means that each axial face seal is designed for a specific shaft diameter rather than a range of shaft diameters like a v-ring. As was the case with v-rings, an axial face seal can either be used in conjunction with a shaft seal to provide additional contamination exclusion or they can be used by themselves in an application. The AFX style axial face seal is similar to the AFS except that the O.D. edge of the metal case extends beyond the rubber sealing lip. Because the metal case extends beyond the sealing lip, a groove needs to be machined into the housing to accept the metal case. In applications where heavy contamination is a concern, an AFX style seal would be better than an AFS because with the metal case extending into the housing there is a labyrinth created. By incorporating a labyrinth into the application the AFX will slow down the migration of the contaminants better than an AFS which will lead to longer seal life."

"2808097","<p>Back-Up Ring Kit, Single Turn, -65 to 500 deg F, PTFE, Import</p></br></br>Back-up rings are used to prevent O-rings from extruding when the tight tolerances listed in the previous section cannot be maintained. Back-up rings do not provide any sealing function. They are simply intended to reduce the extrusion gap on the low-pressure side so that the O-ring can fulfill its sealing function without being damaged. Back-up rings are made of materials with better extrusion resistance than most elastomers. Several common materials are high durometer NBR (or other elastomers), nylon and filled PTFE. Since the materials used for back-up rings are basically non-compressible and non-deformable, they can typically be treated as though they are part of whatever the O-ring groove is machined into. That is, the width of the groove has to be increased just enough to accommodate the thickness of the back-up ring. For back-up rings with a curved surface facing the O-ring, the effective thickness of the back-up ring can be determined by dividing the cross sectional area of the back-up ring by the height of the back-up ring. This ensures that the O-ring has the same area to occupy."

The two pieces of an AO seal are the sealing element and the sleeve. The sealing element of an AO seal can be anything from a standard shaft seal profile to a custom designed seal with multiple contamination exclusion lips. The sleeve that is incorporated into the design acts as the sealing surface for each of the lips on the sealing element. Because of the heavy contaminants that are present around the application there is a higher risk of excessive shaft wear occurring. By using an AO seal, the sleeve removes the risk of shaft wear and aids in extending the life of the shaft."
