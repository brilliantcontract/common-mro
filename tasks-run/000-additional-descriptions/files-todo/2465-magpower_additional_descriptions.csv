The ergonomic properties of Diamond Flex-Lok are the result of a multi-tiered footing design that elevates the mat off the floor, creating air pockets that allow the mat to flex with the weight of the worker. A large hole drainage system facilitates the removal of liquids and debris from the work area while a pronounced raised diamond pattern on the mat surface, and an inverted-V pattern on the ramps provide additional traction. Diamond Flex-Lok is manufactured from 100% recycled PVC for greater resistance to industrial chemicals, cutting fluids, oils and greases.
