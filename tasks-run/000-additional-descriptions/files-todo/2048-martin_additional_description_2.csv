"2926265","<p>This tool set includes 4 Phillips screwdrivers, which come in a pouch for storage. Round Shank Screwdrivers have rust and corrosion resistant finish chrome vanadium steel blades and user friendly industrial design fluted plastic grips.

The round shape allows you to quickly turn the screwdriver by supporting the shank with one hand while turning the handle with the other. Typically, use a parallel sided tip (Cabinetmakers or Electricians) configuration for slotted flat head screws, and a standard slotted flared or winged tip (Mechanics Blade) for slotted round or oval head screws.
