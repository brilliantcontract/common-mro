174446,"<p>When your power transmission application needs a high horsepower solution but is constrained by drive weight or physical space, the answer is Super HC Molded Notch Belts. Our proprietary construction process provides a superior combination of flex and load-carrying capacity, transmitting up to three times the horsepower versus comparably sized belts. Super HC MN V-belts put more power where high speeds, high speed ratios or small pulley diameters are required, offering significant benefits over classical section V-belts. Developed through specialized research, Super HC MN is highly recommended for use on all industrial heavy-duty, narrow section V-belt drives. With an increased transmission efficiency this belt allows for a more compact and highly economical drive design.</p><h5>Specifications</h5><ul><li>Flex-bonded tensile cords are vulcanized as one solid unit making the belt highly resistant to tensile and flexing forces, fatigue and shock loads.</li><li>Precision-ground straight sidewalls give a uniform wedging action and ensure the belt fits correctly in the pulley grooves.</li><li>Molded Notches reduce and evenly distribute thermal and bending stresses.</li></ul>"
