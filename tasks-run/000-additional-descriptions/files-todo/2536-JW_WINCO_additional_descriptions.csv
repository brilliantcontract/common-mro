It is not recommended to move the stud beyond the 15° mark, otherwise the ball end of the stud can pop out of its seat and both stud and pad will separate.</p> <p>Coupling nut is not recommended to use for installation.</p> <p>Use nut or tapped hole of 1 - 1 1/2 times the thread diameter being used.</p> <p>Optional pad is used for non-skid, noise and vibration reduction. Unique solid squared pattern on pad provides for a more positive non-skid surface.</p> <p>Pad resists many organic acids, most chemicals, alkalines, salt, water and corrosion.</p> <p>To insure proper leveling mount size, divide the machine weight by the number of mounts required. This will equal the pounds or load per mount.</p> <p>Maximum load ratings for leveling mounts with elastomer pad are based on a calculation of 40% distortion to the elastomer pad.

5771652,"<h5>Information</h5> <p>GN 41 leveling feet are simple, economically priced components.</p> <p>The static load rating of these feet is limited due to the acceptable load rating of the stud (tensile strength 500/mm2).

Sealing with an O-ring on the periphery and not on the face edge of the glass. Leak tightness is therefore not affected by axial pressures. 3. The seal is housed in a groove and it can therefore not be lost. In addition, this groove prevents the seal from being extruded when the sight glass is tightened. The location of this seal allows also the softer elastomer which guarantees better and easier sealing.</p> <p>Fluid level sight glasses GN 743.1 can be used on pressurized oil tanks. Tests regarding maximum pressure are available upon request. Viton seal: maximum heat resistance: 180°C (356°F). Sight glasses may be ordered without reflectors.

Sealing with an O-ring on the periphery and not on the face edge of the glass. Leak tightness is therefore not affected by axial pressures. 3. The seal is housed in a groove and it can therefore not be lost. In addition, this groove prevents the seal from being extruded when the sight glass is tightened. The location of this seal allows also the softer elastomer which guarantees better and easier sealing.</p> <p>Fluid level sight glasses GN 743.1 can be used on pressurized oil tanks. Tests regarding maximum pressure are available upon request. Viton seal: maximum heat resistance: 180°C (356°F). Sight glasses may be ordered without reflectors.

Sealing with an O-ring on the periphery and not on the face edge of the glass. Leak tightness is therefore not affected by axial pressures. 3. The seal is housed in a groove and it can therefore not be lost. In addition, this groove prevents the seal from being extruded when the sight glass is tightened. The location of this seal allows also the softer elastomer which guarantees better and easier sealing.</p> <p>Fluid level sight glasses GN 743.1 can be used on pressurized oil tanks. Tests regarding maximum pressure are available upon request. Viton seal: maximum heat resistance: 180°C (356°F). Sight glasses may be ordered without reflectors.

With the cats-eye prism effect on the oil color, oil viscosity not-with-standing, the view is quite clear. The real advantage of the prism effect is when over-filling, under-filling and poor lighting situations arise. Should not be used in applications where viewing of alcohol level is required.</p> <p>Fluid level sight glasses can also be used on pressurized tanks. The data on pressure and vacuum tests is available upon request.</p> <p>The O-ring is housed in the same aluminum body as the GN 743 fluid level sight glasses. The sealing is achieved with an O-ring on the periphery and not on the face edge of the glass. Leak tightness is therefore not effected by axial pressures. The seal is put in a groove in the housing and it can therefore not be lost, In addition, this groove prevents the seal from being extruded when the sight glass is tightened. The location of the seal also allows the use of a softer elastomer which guarantees better and easier sealing.</p> <p>Maximum heat resistance: 100°C (212°F). </p> <p>Note: When mounting fluid level sight glasses on walls of less than 4mm (.157"") thick, use mounting nut part series GN 543.1.</p>                 <h5>Specification</h5>                 Body<ul> <li>Aluminum, turned, with matte shot-blast finish  </li> </ul> Prismatic reflector<ul> <li>Transparent plastic </li> </ul> Sealing ring <ul> <li>Nitrile rubber (Perbunan)</li> </ul>                                                                           <h5>Accessory</h5> Fixing nuts GN 543.1                    <h5>On request</h5> EPDM seal             "

With the cats-eye prism effect on the oil color, oil viscosity not-with-standing, the view is quite clear. The real advantage of the prism effect is when over-filling, under-filling and poor lighting situations arise. Should not be used in applications where viewing of alcohol level is required.</p> <p>Fluid level sight glasses can also be used on pressurized tanks. The data on pressure and vacuum tests is available upon request.</p> <p>The O-ring is housed in the same aluminum body as the GN 743 fluid level sight glasses. The sealing is achieved with an O-ring on the periphery and not on the face edge of the glass. Leak tightness is therefore not effected by axial pressures. The seal is put in a groove in the housing and it can therefore not be lost, In addition, this groove prevents the seal from being extruded when the sight glass is tightened. The location of the seal also allows the use of a softer elastomer which guarantees better and easier sealing.</p> <p>Maximum heat resistance: 100°C (212°F). </p> <p>Note: When mounting fluid level sight glasses on walls of less than 4mm (.157"") thick, use mounting nut part series GN 543.1.</p>                 <h5>Specification</h5>                 Body<ul> <li>Aluminum, turned, with matte shot-blast finish  </li> </ul> Prismatic reflector<ul> <li>Transparent plastic </li> </ul> Sealing ring <ul> <li>Nitrile rubber (Perbunan)</li> </ul>                                                                           <h5>Accessory</h5> Fixing nuts GN 543.1                    <h5>On request</h5> EPDM seal             "

With the cats-eye prism effect on the oil color, oil viscosity not-with-standing, the view is quite clear. The real advantage of the prism effect is when over-filling, under-filling and poor lighting situations arise. Should not be used in applications where viewing of alcohol level is required.</p> <p>Fluid level sight glasses can also be used on pressurized tanks. The data on pressure and vacuum tests is available upon request.</p> <p>The O-ring is housed in the same aluminum body as the GN 743 fluid level sight glasses. The sealing is achieved with an O-ring on the periphery and not on the face edge of the glass. Leak tightness is therefore not effected by axial pressures. The seal is put in a groove in the housing and it can therefore not be lost, In addition, this groove prevents the seal from being extruded when the sight glass is tightened. The location of the seal also allows the use of a softer elastomer which guarantees better and easier sealing.</p> <p>Maximum heat resistance: 100°C (212°F). </p> <p>Note: When mounting fluid level sight glasses on walls of less than 4mm (.157"") thick, use mounting nut part series GN 543.1.</p>                 <h5>Specification</h5>                 Body<ul> <li>Aluminum, turned, with matte shot-blast finish  </li> </ul> Prismatic reflector<ul> <li>Transparent plastic </li> </ul> Sealing ring <ul> <li>Nitrile rubber (Perbunan)</li> </ul>                                                                           <h5>Accessory</h5> Fixing nuts GN 543.1                    <h5>On request</h5> EPDM seal             "
