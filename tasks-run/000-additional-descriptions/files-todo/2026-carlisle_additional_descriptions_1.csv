2984430,"<p> The Problem Solver! Super II v-belts are the solution to the constant and costly problem of replacing ordinary v-belts on troublesome drives. Specially formulated fiber-loaded EPDM rubber compounds, engineered fabrics and high-modulus polyester cord offer greater strength, longer life, better heat dissipation and higher efficiencies than best-in-class wrapped v-belts. The unique CNA (central neutral axis) cord placement positions the strength of the belt lower on the pulleys to maintain stability and prevent roll-over. The raw edge construction results in more efficient power transmission and reduced energy loss.</p><p> Features/Advantages </p><ul><li>Higher performance alternative to classical wrapped v-belts</li><li>More energy efficient than wrapped v-belts</li><li>Unique design for longer life</li><li>Less maintenance and downtime</li><li>EPDM rubber compound is static conductive, resistant to hardening and glazing, and operates in a broad temperature range (-50ºF to +250ºF)</li><li>Backed by our Iron Clad Guarantee</li><li>Built to Chek Mate belt tolerances for a matched set</li></ul><p> Applications </p><ul><li>Shaker screens, debarkers, industrial washers and dryers, and more</li></ul><p> Sizes </p><ul><li>A, B and C cross-sections from 17"" to 144""<br><br></li></ul>"
