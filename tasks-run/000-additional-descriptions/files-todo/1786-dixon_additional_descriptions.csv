Replace immediately if damaged or worn. </td></tr><tr><th>Step 3</th><td>It is necessary that the hose is clean and free form oil and dirt before use. </td></tr><tr><th>Step 4</th><td>Compress the tail end of the King Safety Whipsock to open the ID, work the stocking to slide the grip down the length of the hose. Run your hands down the grip from the coupling end to the tail to smooth out any gaps or loose wires in the grip to ensure contact with the hose. </td></tr><tr><th>Step 5</th><td>After coupling, slide the King Safety Whipsock up the hose into secured position just behind the fitting, ensuring the eyes have enough length to reach the anchoring points. Avoid overlapping the stockings if King Safety Whipsocks are on each end of the hose. </td></tr><tr><th>Step 6</th><td>Using a King Safety Shackle or bolt, nut &amp; pin style clasp, rated above the breaking strength of the hose, secure the hose restraint at two horizontally opposed, rigid anchor points rated for the application. </td></tr><tr><th>Step 7</th><td>Slight slack in the legs is preferred. This will allow a travel distance for coupling in disconnection and greatly reduce the load applied to the hose restraint.
