They are manufactured from High Speed Cobalt so can be used for drilling hard materials including tool steel. They also have a bronze oxide finish to make sue the holes are clean and accurate, by preventing workpiece material from sticking to the cutting surfaces of the drill.</p><p>The R10CO drills in this set are of a heavy duty design and are recommended for use in difficult materials and applications.</p>"
