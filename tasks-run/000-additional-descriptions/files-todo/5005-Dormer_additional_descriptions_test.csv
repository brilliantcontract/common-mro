6087081,"<p>209CO taper shank drill bits can be used in machine applications where the drill is held directly in the spindle and are available in many fractional sizes from 1/4"" to one and a half inches, making them a very versatile choice.</p><p>The bronze oxide finish helps prevent workpiece material from sticking to the cutting edges of the tool for a clean and accurate finish, whilst the 135 degree thinned point helps with self-centering and reduces the push force required.</p><p>209CO drill bits are manufactured from premium High Speed cobalt so are suitable for drilling many materials, including aluminum, stainless steel and steels.</p>"
6091590,"<p>Adjustable circular split die, for ISO-Metric thread M12 with 1.75 mm pitch, to reduce the torque when cutting by hand split dies can be adjusted in small increments up to a maximum of approximately 0.15mm, dimensions according to ANSI standard with 1.1/2"" outside diameter and 1/2"" thickness, HSS with bright finish for threading in free machining and plain carbon steel and gray, malleable, ductile and compacted graphite cast-iron.</p>"
6076167,"<p>Centesimal reamer with left hand slow spiral flutes and a cylindrical shank, diameter 4.98mm with an overall length of 86mm, a flute length of 23mm and 52mm reach with neck relief, according to DIN 212 standard with a diameter tolerance of 0/+0.004mm to produce holes within diameter-tolerance 5N10 or 5N11, cobalt based HSS-E with bright finish for machining free machining, plain carbon and alloy steel, grey and malleable cast-iron, wrought and cast aluminium and copper or copper alloys.</p>"
6091805,"<p>Interchangeable pilot for use with counterbore bodies with, pilot diameter 13/16"" with an overall length of 2.1/2"" and a pilot guide length of 7/8"" and 5/16"" straight shank with flat, according to ANSI standard, HSS with standard bright finish general purpose applications.</p>"
6073114,"<p>A member of Dormer’s ADX range of high performance drills, the A553 drill with oil feed is capable of producing high quality, accurate holes (to H9 tolerance), even at high speeds and feeds.</p> <p>The A553 has a 130 degree thinned point which helps stop the tool from skipping over the surface of the workpiece when you start the hole and also means you don’t need to apply as much force to get the drill to cut the material.</p> <p>The titanium nitride coating extends the life of the drill and also gives better performance when drilling harder materials.</p> <p>The A553 has a specially shaped cutting edge which helps break up the chips from the workpiece so they are removed from the hole more quickly and you can drill at faster speeds and feeds.</p> <p>The A553 metric drills are made from premium High Speed steels which means you can use them to drill a wide range of material including stainless steels, steels and aluminium</p>"
6079304,"<p>S991SET944 comprises six of the more popular diameters of S944 milling cutters in a single set.</p> <p>The tools can be used for plunging, ramping and profile milling in steels, cast iron and stainless steels.</p> <p>Manufactured from premium carbide for great performance and tool life, they also have a titanium aluminium nitride coating which further improves tool life and helps improve performance when milling materials which are difficult to machine.</p> <p>The medium length flute design provides high rigidity for standard profile milling.</p> <p>S991SET944 milling cutters are a smart, economical range for general milling of slots on most types of machine</p>"
